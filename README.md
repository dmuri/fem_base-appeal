# FrontendMentor.io Challenge
Completed challenge with responsive design. The project is built using HTML and CSS

## About the project
Im fairly proud of this one as the responsiveness of it was quite challenging for me. The layout is not perfect and there are still some improvments to me made, forexample the background is abit off compared with the targeted design. But overall a fun and challenging project by Frontend Mentor.
